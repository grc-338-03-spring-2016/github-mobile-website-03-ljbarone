       <h1> Personal Interests</h1> 
         <p> I am 21 years old and I have accomplished many goals throughout my life so far. But, this life has so much to offer and I have many more plans and goals that I hope to fulfill during my time on earth. One of my biggest accomplishments was studying abroad in Spain. My study abroad experience was a huge learning experience where I was placed outside of my comfort zone. During my trip I learned to love cultures, languages, traveling alone and with friends, and also relying completely on myself. </p>
