    <div class="aboutme">
         <p>I am 21 years old and I have accomplished many goals throughout my life so far. But, this life has so much to offer and I have many more plans and goals that I hope to fulfill during my time on earth. One of my biggest accomplishments was studying abroad in Spain. My study abroad experience was a huge learning experience where I was placed outside of my comfort zone. During my trip I learned to love cultures, languages, traveling alone and with friends, and also relying completely on myself. I love to travel and after studying abroad, my desire to travel has increased.</p>

    <div class="abroad">
        <p>While I was abroad, I had the opportunity to live with a host family. This placed me out of my comfort zone, but it was such an amazing experience. I was able to live with a family who only spoke Spanish. This family cooked for me everyday so I was able to eat authentic Spanish foods. I also took all of my classes in Spanish and even participated in a surfing class. I cannot wait to see what other adventures I will get to experience in the near future.</p>
